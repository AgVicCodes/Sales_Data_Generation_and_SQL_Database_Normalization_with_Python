# SQL Database Normalization with Python

## Introduction
This project focuses on demonstrating SQL database normalization techniques, up to the third normal form (4NF), using Python. The goal is to organize a database efficiently to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It includes automated data generation for a sales transaction dataset, utilizing the **Faker** Python library. Faker creates realistic sales transactions, simulating customer, product, and order data.

An automation pipeline is also set up in the `.github/workflows` directory using GitHub Actions. This pipeline automates the process of generating data and updating the database with each new commit, ensuring fresh data is consistently available for normalization scripts.
